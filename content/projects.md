Some of the projects that I've worked on:

### BATTLE BOTS
Senior Design in Progress: [Battlebot](https://amarokbot.com/).

### MSP430 Microcontroller

We programmed TI's [MSP430G2553](https://www.ti.com/product/MSP430G2553) microcontroller to learn about microcontrollers and used functionalilites like [interrupts](https://github.com/yosapkota/MSP430-Projects/tree/main/Lab4), [UART](https://github.com/yosapkota/MSP430-Projects/tree/main/Lab5), [ADC](https://github.com/yosapkota/MSP430-Projects/tree/main/ADC), PWM etc. Additional peripheral implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/yosapkota/MSP430-Projects).


### Programming TM4C123GXL Launchpad

Programmed Tiva C series launchpad to implement ADC,  PWM to control servo motor, traffic light simulator & stepper motor control using Finite State Machines, communication protocols like SPI to interface a display, and stepper-motor driven joystick controlled toy car.

### VHDL Codes

Some [VHDL codes](https://github.com/yosapkota/VHDL-Examples) written using Xilinx Vivado.

### Coding Projects

Some of the projects that I've done for CS classes and for fun.\
[Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/yosapkota/Sudoku-Solver)\
[Cops and Robbers Game](https://github.com/yosapkota/Cops-and-Robbers)\
[Word and Ladder Game](https://github.com/yosapkota/Words-and-Ladders-Game)

Hi! I'm Yogesh Sapkota, a graduate Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Youngstown State University. \
I am interested in electronics, programming embedded systems and machine learning on embedded devices.
Currently, I am working on developing a variable frequency drive for three-phase induction motor using Arty-A7 FPGA development board. 

Here's a [link](https://shorturl.at/cBKLO) to my resume. 

I am a huge [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) and [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/) fan.
